A PHP script for starting MODx Extras from modExtra. It does the replacement and directory renaming. To use, run via cli. To use, run via cli: php modx.startextra.php <project_name_ucfirst_plural> <copyright_info_path>

The first arguement passed to the script is the name of your Extra (i.e Doodles).  The script currently takes this value and maniputlates it in various ways to make it usable for replacing values.  For example:
	modExtra -> Doodles
	modextra -> doodles
	Item -> Doodle
	item -> doodle

I tried to find anything this might break, but there still may be important (ExtJS type) things replaced.  It is a work in progress.

The second parameter is a path to a file with copyright and license information, in case your name isn't Shaun McCormick.  ;-)  Perhaps you don't want to release your MODx Extra under the GPL.
